<h3>Mac Shaughnessy</h3>
<div class="img-box"> <img class="about-us-img" src="Mac.jpg"> </div>
<p>Mac is a Computer and Electrical Engineering Major at Clemson University.
He was born and raised in the Charlotte area. He enjoys spending time with
his family and trips to the beach, hanging out with friends and playing
basketball. While he loves basketball he knew he wouldn't be in the NBA. 
Eventually finding another passion in computers. His computer passion
began when he got my first phone and jailbroke it so he could have full
control of the phone. This led him to building his own computer for his
high school senior project. Mac has plans to graduate Clemson in 2023.</p>
